# Home-Inventory-Manager-Project

Purpose
Use this app to keep track of the items that you own. Your home inventory can serve as documentation of asset values for insurance coverage and claims and for charitable contributions. Alternatively, use the app as a wish list of items that you want to purchase or receive as a gift. Or if youâ€™re a follower of the voluntary simplicity lifestyle, use the app to become more aware of how little you own and the future purchases you want to avoid.

App features include category filtering, custom categories, image uploading, and personalized inventory accounts via Google authorization.

While home inventory tracking is the original purpose of the app, it can be repurposed to track almost anything, e.g., vinyl records, baseball cards, comic books, stamps, coins, etc.
